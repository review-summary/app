        "content": "Lego nerd and college student here. I didn\u2019t get paid to write a review. This set is a bit underwhelming, especially compared to some of the other Lego Harry Potter sets released thus far. I would only recommend it if you\u2019ve boughten all the other Harry Potter sets and need it to complete the collection. When I gave this set to my 9 year old cousin, it took him only 15 minutes to build, and was not challenging at all. The figures are not unique (both versions of Harry and Ron appear in the Hogwarts Express set.) They do have double sided heads though (as seen in the pictures.) Aragog the spider is sleek, and stands well, but he does not have many play features, other than his pincers and his abdomen, which moves up and down. The moving abdomen, quite frankly isn\u2019t even really a play feature, even if the instructions seem to suggest  so. Admittedly, though, Aragog is quite adorable and looks great on display. The small spiders are made out of hard plastic which is nice. The tree is your standard Lego tree, with nothing special to note, other than a flick-fire stud shooter which fires a web piece shown in one of the photos. The set also includes some extra parts as shown in my photos. My set came in a smashed box which seems to be a theme with some of the other reviews here (which is why I did not photograph the box this time.) Overall, while it\u2019s not a terrible set, I\u2019d pass on this one unless you absolutely need it.",

For the name brand item, I expected all the parts to be included. There was a similar-shaped brown piece that was not used in the build, but it is too small to become part of the abdomen; perhaps it was accidentally included? We were excited to get the kit but disappointed that it is incomplete. We're using this to decorate the house for Halloween otherwise I would have returned the kit and requested a replacement. I did not find a place to contact Amazon about the missing part, and I doubt a replacement would arrive before Halloween.",

        "content": "If you're looking for a small LEGO gift for that Harry Potter fan out there, then this set is perfect. This LEGO set comes with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, as well as, a large version of Aragog (which looks awesome by the way). The set also comes with 5 smaller spiders (two black and three brown). The final completed lair scene looks nice and features a decent amount of playability considering the smaller size of this set. Both Harry and Ron feature dual faces. As you can see in my images, one version of their face is 'all is well' while the other version is absolutely scared and frightened. I really enjoy when LEGO offers alternate faces because you can then do a lot more in regard to scene creation and role playing. The small torch that Harry is carrying is nice and the lit lantern that Ron has is definitely impressive. For a set this small, there is quite a lot of detail and creative approach to the LEGO design and building. There's a lot of movement and playability with Aragog as you can articulate the legs as well as the eyes and back portion of the spider. I'm also a big fan of all the brown LEGO pieces and different shades of brown offered in this set. Overall, this set is on the smaller side, but it does pack a decent size punch. I recommend this set for both Harry Potter fans and even those who aren't, as there's much offered in this set. Thank you for reading. Hopefully you found my review helpful. If so, please let me know below. Happy bricking!",

As a mom, can't help but notice that this would make a great Halloween present, and is actually more spookily festive, and less expensive, than many of the holiday-specific offerings from Lego. Really fun little set, for Harry Potter fans or just as a non-edible Halloween trick-or-treat.",

The 'shooting' web is a bit pointless (you flick it with a finger, may as well throw a brick in that case) but the tree is properly creepy with webs and moss growing on it. Glad we got it!",

It's relatively inexpensive, the minifigures are well made, the new Aragog has some nice elements and it's good to get a number of the smaller spiders. That being said, it's a little too basic and feels a bit limited in play value as a stand alone set compared to the creepy Forrest the scene is based on. The build is all about the spiders and Aragog is good but the eyes look a little comical to me. The lair itself is just a small tree that feels overly \"bright\". Would have been nice to see it have a darker tone to it to help with the overall feeling of the set. Pros: -Aragog is big and well built -Harry and Ron look good in a change of pace from the Hogwarts gear -Get a lot of spiders Cons: -Build is very small and overly basic",

She's also very happy with the Harry and Ron that came in the set, too.  It fits very nicely when set near the new Hogwarts Castle.
